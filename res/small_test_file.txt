review/summary: Great charger
review/text: I recently bought this charger kit from Amazon and I am quite happy with my purchase. The folding plug is nice for storage. The included 1850 mAh batteries last for a long time in my Nikon Coolpix 2100. One of the best features of the charger is that each battery is charged separately (as opposed to in pairs) so that each battery gets just the right amount of charge. The short 3 hour charge time is great as well. The batteries do not get overly warm while charging either.Overall, this is a good charger for a good price. If you have a high drain device, the Kodak K2000 should keep you playing for a long time.

review/summary: Super product! I'm very happy.
review/text: The batteries are excellent (1850's), and the charger is super fast, and stops charging when done. I love that you just plug the unit right into the wall with no unruly cords. My Sony digital only takes 2 AA batteries, so with this charger, I always have two sets of spare batteries with me in my case. This charger even charges up my SONY AA batteries that came with the camera.Highly recommended!

review/summary: Problem with charging smaller AAAs
review/text: I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is.

review/text: I have used and recharged my batteries nearly 100 times already and it shows no sign of giving out. Perfect for remote controls or other battery "hungry" devices, but they work just like normal batteries as far as life span is concerned. I would recommend this product to anyone!

review/summary: Works, but not as advertised
review/text: I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a "backup" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger.

review/summary: Great! But please read on before purchasing ext batteries!
review/text: This is simpily the best rechargable batteries I have ever own!But there is a slight issue in which is the reason why I have to return this for something else - different mAh ratings!The charger comes with 1700mAh Batteries!!! Not 1850!!!!!!I purchase this for use in my GPS/GMRS radios (which eats 3 per unit). So natually, I purchase this charger with extra Kodak Max K2000 batteries (same product name, and pretty looks the same in picture) but the problem is that the extra set is rated at 1850! I was planning to use those on my gps, but if the ratings are different, my data between the units might be incorrect.Bottom line, if 4 batteries are all you need, or you can use them in sets of 2 or all 4 at once. GO FOR IT!!! I am a gadget freak and I test many different products frequently. When it comes to batteries - this is it, hands down.

review/summary: Great
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that this charger was so small. The others that I looked at were larger. I also appreciate the fact that this one doesn't have a long cord that has to be curled up when I'm not using it. It takes up much less room in the camera bag. Another plus is that the plug folds under when not in use. That makes the unit even more compact and the plug is less likely to scratch something when stored away.

review/text: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.

review/summary: Great Compact Charger
review/text: I need a fast, compact charger that could easily fit into my digital camera bag. Other chargers are compact, BUT the electric cord takes up a lot of room. This charger DOES NOT have an electric cord to contend with, Instead, it has a collapsable plug, which folds completely hidden into the unit when not in use, allowing it to be placed neatly into the camera bag pocket.With the storage issue taken care of, the performance of this unit is above expectations. The recharging process is less than 3 hours. Unlike other models, you can recharge either one, two three or all four batteries at once and still get a full charge on all batteries. The two battery option is nice for my kids walkie-talkie batteries. The shut down mode when complete is a nice option that is really needed, especially for the time when you forget about the charger until the next morning.I've tried several other chargers and this is the BEST model that I have worked with. Compact, easy storage, fast charging, auto shutdown, charge less than 4 at a time. ALL the options I need for a battery charger.

review/summary: Fast Charges; Long Lasting Power--but weak spring mechanism.
review/text: The charger makes quick work out of charging all four batteries simultaneously, and automatically shuts off when finished, which is very convenient--no more burned out batteries.Also, the batteries, 1850 mAH, which come with this charger seem to be the highest rated you can buy, and do last very long. Just out of the box, without prior charging, they already outperfomed the Alkalines I had been using previously in my Canon A70. Definately a great buy.One complaint, however, is that the springs that come down to hold smaller AAAs in place break too easily, and will not firmly hold AAAs in place while charging. This has absolutely no affect on Double A batteries, but is an annoyance when trying to charge triple A batteries. It will still charge them, but it's a hassle trying to get the batteries to stay in place when the clip does not hold them sturdily.Overall, a sufficient battery charger. If you are just using it to charge AAs, this is perfect. If you will primarily be charging AAAs, I would look into a different charger, perhaps one that does not involve spring-loading holding mechanisms at all.

review/summary: A simple, reliable, compact, and fast charger
review/text: After reading the reviews, I bought this charger. It is everything the positive reviewers are saying. It is simple to use, just fold out the electric prongs and plug into a wall outlet or extension cord. In 3 hours, up to 4 NiMH AA batteries are charged (you can charge 1 to 4 batteries at a time). This charger will shut itself off when it is done charging--in 3 hours. It has lights for each battery telling you when it is charging and the lights go out to let you know that the batteries are fully charged. Since the electric prongs can fold in, the charger can easily fit into a camera bag, or pocket. It is about 2-1/2" by 5" (inches) in dimension. This is an excellent product!!!

review/summary: Great Charger
review/text: I bought this charger to go with my handheld Garmin GPS unit. Once I got this unit, I did some testing using Energizer batteries. I did a full charge of these batteries and they ran as long if not a bit longer than the Energizer batteries. So once you calculate that these can be charged 800 times, they are a MUCH better deal than buying normal batteries all the time. I also bought a 4 pack of the 1850mAh batteries because all the reviews said the charger came with 1700's and the 1850's were that much better. They were wrong, the charger came with 4 1850's so save your[money]on the extra pack.

review/text: This battery charger only takes three, yes THREE hours to charge up to 4 AA or AAA batteries. Some of my friends' chargers take 8 hours (overnight) to a full day to charge batteries and they hate it. They paid the same or even more for their chargers too! Switch to this charger and you will never complain. It is one of the fastest chargers and also includes four AA 1700 mAh NiMH batteries which is valued up to $ so this is a great buy. One of the best chargers because it is lightweight, the plug can be folded into the charger, and is super fast!

review/text: I have really enjoyed using these 1850 NiMH Batteries - they last quite a long time in my A70 digital camera and CD player and the charge time is very quick compared to others. Plus, the fact that you can charge each battery individually is very nice, since it prevents overcharging of any battery. Others charge 2 batteries at once and that assumes that both need to charge as long as the other. Also, the charger works well with AA and AAA NiCad and NiMH batteries. Great buy...

review/text: You said "...but the charge only lasts a very short time."Did you know that new Ni-MH batteries must be cycled 3 to 5 times before they hold a full charge? This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity. This may be your problem. Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Does what it says it will
review/text: This is a nice combo DVD/VCR. I've had it for a couple of years now and have had no problems. That's really why I'm writing; I want to let people know the ones with problems are probably the exception rather than the rule.The only disadvantages to this product for me:1) On the VCR, you can't FF by time (a panasonic feature; FF a given number of minutes)2) Once you set the VCR program, you must hit TIMER (not just power off) to get it to use the program. Okay, hitting TIMER will turn the power off, but let's say you want to record something later in the week. You will turn your deck on and off several times in that period. Do you want to hit TIMER every time? And by the way, hitting TIMER doesn't just turn the deck off, it switches to DVD mode. In theory, this is nice so you can still use your DVD player while recording a show. In practice you just end up turning off two things (VCR via TIMER, DVD via power) most of the time.3) No S-video input. I had to buy a S-video to composite video adapter to record something from my PC video card. By the way, don't do this; the quality is pretty low.Little advantages to this product for me:1) Front panel inputs; I use this to dub from my video camera very often2) Comprehensive remote; for me, the more buttons the better. I hate on-screen menus. How can I see what the picture looks like when I adjust the tracking if 88% of the screen is the tracking menu?3) Many flavors of A/V OUTPUT: digital audio (coax and optical), composite video (of course), component video (nice for home theater), S video.Bottom line: A good combo deck for the money.

review/summary: Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!
review/text: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$.

review/summary: Great Combo Package!
review/text: I decided to wait over a year to write a review on this unit, and thankfully my opinion since the first day I got it hasn't changed. It's wonderful! I was suprised to find a full feature DVD player included. A friend of mine bought a relatively expensive DVD player and it didn't have some of the features this unit has (albeit its a bit smaller). I have never experienced performance issues while using the DVD player in 12+ months. Zoom feature comes in handy as well, if you rent DVDs and don't necessarily want the whole long apect ratio. VCR works great as well. Recordings done in SP look excellent, colors are great and its not grainy at all. EP recordings look great for being EP as well, if you sit back on the couch you can't tell the difference. Only problem there is sometimes it takes a few seconds to track with EP, but it normally finds the right setting fairly quickly. The remote is easy to use once you learn it. It can be confusing at first, but now I wouldn't use anything else. It can control all the TV functions as well at the combo unit. If you want to take a small step into the world of DVD players, but not let go of your old VHS tapes, this is the player for you. Especially now, with the price quite reduced from when I bought it. You will not be disappointed!

review/summary: It started out fine, but....
review/text: I've had this for just over a month. I had read other reviews on this product prior to purchasing, and to me it seemed like it had received good reviews as simple-to-use machine with good attribues for not-so-electronic-literate person like myself. It had been working just fine, until few days ago I was playing a DVD and all of a sudden it would freeze, and on the TV screen there would be many different colored squares, completely distorting the image. And now, the Dvd player does not even recognize any format (I've tried CDs, DVDs, and even VCDs), as it only says &quot;Incorrect Disc&quot;.I just now found another review where the person had the same problem, had to take it to a local service center, got fixed, came back, and the exact same problem popped back up three weeks later.Reading that, I don't even know if I want to even bother taking it to get it fixed. Since it still plays VHS perfectly fine, maybe I'll just invest in a simple DVD player, which defeats the whole purpose of why I bought a DVD/VHS combo player in the first place....

review/summary: Good player but wish I could change a few things
review/text: Overall, this player works great and was fairly easy to set up. However, the display is ugly (orange lettering that reminds me of my alarm clock) and only displays minutes, not seconds. Also, the lack of universal remote is a drawback. Finally, I was disappointed to learn that you can only record on the VCR in SP (2 hr) or EP (6 hour) speeds. Maybe this is standard now, but I've always liked LP mode for taping movies so you could fit two on a tape. This stuff may seem trivial. Anyway, that's my two cents.

review/summary: Does The Job
review/text: I have had this DVD/VCR combo for a couple of weeks and it does the jobs it is supposed to. Some reviews have said the machine was noisy I have not found this to be the case,I don't even notice the DVD player making noise.It was also easy to set up and comes in crystal clear.The most important aspect for me is that you can record a TV show and watch a DVD at the same time.Some reviews stated that the VCR did not play back recorded shows well especialy if it was recorded on another vcr, I have not found this to be the case. If you do you may not have set the tape to the right speed,you have to do it manualy.The one thing that bugs me is when you have the timer program on and you want to use the vcr you have to shut the timer off and when your done turn it on again or your prgrams will not record.

review/summary: JVC Combo Drive
review/text: I bought this unit for one reason - to play back DVD's I write with my HP DVD200i DVD+RW drive. The unit's specs don't mention DVD+RW but it's there. The MP3 quality is also excellent through my Bose system. It would have been nice if the MP3 directory wasn't limited to 200 titles per CD but not really a problem. Great unit.

Good way to be able to move up to DVD while still having quick access to your VHS tapes, with the same equipment & hookup. A good choice at a reasonable price.

review/text: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.

review/text: I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a &quot;incorrect disc&quot; message.

review/summary: One very useful Product for the Video Enthusiast
review/text: This is one of the newest and hottest new combination DVD/VCR combinations on the market today. Upon picking up my purchase of the HR-XVC1U I was impressed. The finish and construction of this product is first rate, and it provides just about every feature one could hope for in a combination unit. Although it does not provide progressive scan for the HD TV owner, for those of us who have a 2 to 3 year old large screen set of 32 - 36 or projection size, it performs admirably. It will play SVHS tapes, and record and play VHS with a clarity I have not seen even on my older SVHS unit. It will also record VHS and show a DVD at the same time. Hook ups and Outputs will impress even the most demanding. The DVD will play all DVD and CD formats. The Remote, it should be noted, is not Universal with the exception of other JVC products, and the Users manual was obviously written by someone with English as a second language. However, if you are able to look past these small limitations, you will not be disappointed. I highly reccomend this product.

review/summary: Perfect for its price!
review/text: I purchased this JVC VHS/DVD combo player after my old VCR pooped out and when I decided I needed a DVD player in my room in addition to the one in our family room. I bought this player when it first came out; VHS/DVD combo players were brand new and seemed much more sensible than separate players. However, I had reservations about this unit, wondering if the quality of the DVD and VHS portions would suffer since both were crammed into one box. My fears were unfounded-- this indeed is a fantastic player!First, I really enjoy the chrome finish; it perfectly matches my silver 24&quot; flat-screen TV. Second, I love the unit's included remote. All of the buttons are solidly formed, and the rew/play/ff/rec/stop/pause buttons glow in the dark for watching movies late at night. Third, the quality of VHS recording is wonderful. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they complain of poor quality tape recording; everything I've taped, even on the &quot;EP&quot; (extra-long play) setting, has come out wonderfully. Sometimes, programs taped on certain VCRs look fuzzy on other sets in the house (i.e. if I try to record downstairs with a different VCR and play it back in my room), but anything I tape with this JVC unit is crystal clear on each set in our house. Fourth, I love the different A/V options the JVC unit is capable of utilizing. The JVC unit allows RCA, composite, S-Video, and component cable connections, so use whatever connection works with your TV. I strongly recommend using the component cable hookup as it offers the highest-quality picture. Fifth, I love the functions of the DVD player. Not only does this JVC player offer standard DVD functions like subtitles and markers, it also offers cool functions like zooming. DVDs, CDs, CD-Rs, and VCDs are supported, but SVCDs are not. Sixth, this quality piece of equipment comes at a great price. JVC makes a great unit, and the price is affordable, so don't buy another brand in hopes of getting a better deal.The JVC VHS/DVD player has several A/V options, provides high-quality recording, looks great, comes with a super remote, supports many popular disc formats, and does all of these things for an affordable price. If you're looking for a high-quality, yet modestly-priced piece of equipment to handle your VHS and DVD needs, look no further than this great JVC unit.

review/summary: it's a good quality unit for the money
review/text: Trying to get two audio pieces into one box, offering decent quality, plenty of useful features & low cost may be impossible. I looked at many brands. I needed a unit that has "optical" output for DTS & 5.1 digital to go into my Marantz SR 8000 audio receiver. The cheapest units do not have this, so stay with the better name brands. At this price point I seriously doult that any brand will be very reliable. These units are not being made in Japan, which stood for excellent quality. Instead, China, Tawain, etc. are making them. Making two units into one may save on some costs, but the cost cutting may be the use of cheaper parts inside. So don't expect much from these units.I wanted to replace my older DVD player with one that plays CD-R, CD-RW, and MP3. I purchased the JVC HRXVC1, based on good reviews. JVC is the inventor of VHS vcr, and I have known people to have good luck with their electronics. I also like Panasonic,which makes very reliable electronics. I have had 3 good vcrs with Panasonic, but the clerk said that they were having higher than normal returns on their combo players. Had it not been for that, I would stay with Panasonic.This JVC HRXVC1 vcr/dvd combo has more than enough features needed to play tapes & discs. At this pricepoint it appears to be one of the best featured units I've seen. Hooking it up to my surround receiver was difficult, probably just my fault, although the book isn't clear on the hookup of the "optical" setup with the receiver connections with VCR, etc. Once hooked up, it was worth the effort. The setup was quick and easy. The cds sounded great. The dvd's are crystal clear. The vcr recorded tapes are playing good, and no problems....The GOOD: 1).It works & sounds great. 2.) It looks great on the shelf as well. 3.) There are plenty of features for the money such as Skip Search, index serch, zero return, and three step zoom. 4.) There are front inputs for camcorder or mp3 player to record easy. 5.) This unit has "SQPB" S-VHS Quasi playback which will play S-VHS tapes, and makes for excellent looking viewing of standard tapes. 6.) It has 19um head, for better picture quality in EP mode. 7.) It includes "Spatializer N-2-2" surround for people whose sytems are not setup for surround sound yet. 8.) In use, the rewind & forward is very fast.The BAD: 1.) the remote [is not good]. 2.)the buttons on the box seem unorthodox in their layout. 3.) it's confusing getting around from vcr to dvd, as some buttons have dual use, and buttons are on both sides of the unit. Petty problems, but at least the unit works fine- so far. If it proves to be unreliable, I'll write back.

review/summary: Good DVD Average VCR
review/text: Usually anyone purchasing a combination DVD/VCR player has particular criteria they are meeting in order to get both forms of video into their television. Space, convenience, budget among other reasons comes to mind. That aside, looking at an actual unit the person is most likely more interested about the VCR. DVD reproduction at this level looks so good that it is almost a given fact that it will perform up to someone's expectations. The VCR is another matter. For my own needs I am concerned about the playback of pre-recorded tapes and playback of home VHS recordings that I made. How the DVD/VCR player records in VHS is also important but to a lesser degree. JVC brand VCRs are an interesting and confusing animal when it comes to playback of tapes. I own two JVC S-VHS recorders with flying erase heads. I also own several SONY and older RCA VCRs from the good old days. The problem with JVC is that they play certain tapes back beautifully and others dreadfully. I took several samples of video tape recordings and demonstrated playback on this unit just to see for myself. (I know salesmen at a local electronics store in the area and they always let me try out equipment. They just love low-end technology guys like me.) Pre-recorded movies looked acceptable and I really mean no better than acceptable. Recordings I made on my JVC units in SP and EP modes looked excellent on this unit. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the SP mode look very good. RCA recordings in SP look average. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the EP mode looked horrible. They looked like blurred images without any trace of definition. Recordings I made on my other RCA units in LP and EP modes again looked blurred without any trace of definition. However, I made an actual recording on this unit from a satellite broadcast and the playback looked excellent. The bottom line on this unit is that the DVD side looked very good and the VCR performed just about the same as my stand-alone units which I own. There were really no surprises. When I make recordings at home I indicate which VCR the recording was made on just for the very reasons I mentioned above. After many years I have found that a recording usually looks best when played back on the unit it was made from. The reality today is that VHS is an outdated but necessary technology because many of us have a monetary and/or sentimental investment in tape recordings. I think this JVC unit is good but I rate it based upon how I would be using it relative to my library of VHS recordings and how they are going to look.

review/summary: Easy Set Up
review/text: Love this machine! Works great! Set up was easy, although I probably made it harder than it needed to be.I spent some time trying to understand the manual. I finallly just went for it and found setting up the machine was easy.I connected the cable to the dvd player, the color coded cords from the DVD player to the TV &amp; TADA! I was done.I was able to view a VHS tape immediately or switch to a DVD. What's nice about this machine is that I don't have to got through a lot of gyrations to view a DVD or VHS tape. The Sanyo I used to have required all kinds of set up just to view a DVD. (The moon had to be in Aquarious in the seven house and the planets had to be in alignment, just kidding). But seriously, I had to write down the steps for the Sanyo just to remember how to use it. Don't think you'll have that problem with this machine. A happy customer.

review/summary: Great VCR/DVD
review/text: I have to say that this is a great DVD/VCR player. The vcr picture is clear and sharp. I wish that it had VCR+, but instead you have to program the tv shows you want to tape mannually. There should also be an eject button on the remote for the vcr. It's easy to set up, although the user manul is a little confusing, and when you are done setting up what you want to record you have to press the timmer button in order for it to record the shows you want, which is a little annoying. The DVD is great, it also had a clear and sharp picture and works great. I would reccommend buying this JVC combo, because it works great, easy to set up and very little trouble.

I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality.

review/summary: Great DVD, mediocre VCR
review/text: This is a fine unit for DVD playback, and has a lot of great features. But my experience with the VCR side left a lot to be desired. The machine has been saddled with a sub-par tuner which makes for noisy, color smeared VHS recordings, and its playback of factory pre-records isn't all that great either (but I will say that EP recordings don't fall off very much quality wise from SP, although the frequency response at both speeds is pretty atrocious). JVC brags about how it's the inventor of VHS. . . shame they couldn't do better here.

So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!

review/summary: Good TV for the price - MORONIC remote
review/text: I purchased my 6620LDG, like other reviewers, to replace my old kitchen TV. I really wanted an LCD with a built-in DVD player. While I like the TV just fine, the remote is another story. I actually wrote to the manufacturer about the remote and gave them quite an earful. Included in my e.mail was the following:"While I find the overall TV to be good, I am appalled at thequality and functionality of the remote that operates and comes withthat particular model. I simply can't believe that a name brand likeSylvania would provide such a poorly designed remote to accompany ahigher-end TV.""...this remote is very uncomfortableto hold and operate. It is as if your designers made no accommodationsfor how people hold remotes, and what makes them comfortable.""Seriously. I cantt imagine who designed the actual size and shape of that remote or which idiot approved it's public distribution, but the entire lot of them need to find other professions if they think that this remote is at all acceptable.""A remote should be, at the very least,functional and comfortable enough to go unnoticed, dont you think???? Aside from the horrid shape, size and weight of the remote, this remote has an absolutely terrible layout and lacks some of the most basic buttons that come with the cheapest of remotes. I was shocked and horrified to realize that this hideous remote had no "last channel" button. Are your designers living in the 70s or do they just have their heads up their butts?""I havent had a TV remote in my hand without a last channel button in at LEAST 20 years. Since the remote is so huge, how could it not have one of the most traditional buttons on it? I consider the very lowest and feature-less remotes to be those in hotel rooms. They look like top-of-the-line models when compared to this piece of crap.On top of not having the basic buttons, and amongst other issues, the remote is frustrating because: 1. The text is illegible, 2. The buttons are laid out in a way that doesnt make sense and 3. When you channel surf, the remote is so slow to change the channel that you want to throw it on the floor and stomp on it. In fact, if I can find a universal remote that works with this TV; I intend to do just that. Of course, to add insult to injury, it states clearly in your owners manual that 'We do not recommend the use ofuniversal remote controls. Not all of the functions may be controlledwith a universal remote control.' Great, so you provide a bottom of thebarrel remote with your TV, but then dont allow your customers to get adecent remote by making your TV uncooperative with them. This is thefirst time that I have encountered this too, BTW."Finally:"I hope that you promptly change the remote that comes with the 6620LDG LCD TV/DVD combo TV. I expect that you will experience many returns of this product due to the crappy remote that comes with it."THIS was their entire response:"Thank you for taking the time to express your concerns regarding our product. Your comments and opinions are important to us. Please understand that it is our objective to provide the best possible product. We hope you accept our apologies for the inconvenience you have experienced with our product."I am on the verge of taking this back because of the remote.

The picture got great reviews which yes it does have a good picture to look at but there are other important qualities you enjoy that makes viewing tv all the better. For example: sound... how was that forgotten?In this flat panel, it was. What a disappointment. If this is consider stereo than why does it sound like its coming from a tin can with no base at all. Then too boot, if you play the dvd, the sound drops and you have to really turn up the volume to hear.I want the whole package deal: space saving, great picture, and good sound. I want to enjoy the whole experience of watching and listening. How about you?

review/summary: *** BEWARE ***
review/text: This TV is set so that it is not capable of a "recall" function. If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you. The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back. It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying.

review/summary: Nice for the money
review/text: The first one I bought was defective. The DVD didn't work at all. I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price.

review/summary: Great little camcorder, except...
review/text: I have used many video cameras in my life, but I have never owned one until now. I worked at audio/video stores for several years and saw lots of different formats and brands come and go. Never a fan of the VHS format or its junky little brother, Compact VHS, I knew 8mm was the way to go, at least back then. Nowadays, though, Mini DV seems to be taking over with even smaller cassettes and better picture quality. However, I don't have that kind of money to afford a DV or Digital 8mm camcorder. Yet.Enter the TRV-108, a nifty little video camera that uses the HiBand 8mm format, superior to 8mm, but certainly not in the ballpark of Digital8 or DV. Still, its compact size and light weight make it easy to carry around almost anywhere and given the first 8mm camcorder I ever used was big enough that part of it sat on my shoulder, this is a great improvement. It comes with a 160 minute `InfoLithium' battery and little else except a lens cap and strap. It takes great pictures and has a nifty menu system navigated by a little wheel at the back that works like like a volume control and when you have selected what you want from the on-screen display, you just press the wheel to make it happen. This makes titling a snap. I do miss the title image-grabbing function from older 8mm cameras, though.The 2.5" color back lit LCD screen is clear and easy to read in all but the brightest sunlight and failing that, it also has a small .5" black and white display through the view finder. The 40x zoom is fantastic, but you better have steady hands in order to use it. And using the 460x digital zoom is impossible with anything but a tripod. The camera is equipped with a nightshot mode that actually does work, amplifying light in dark areas, making the image more visible, if green. The TRV-108 also comes with some neat digital effects like sepia tone, which gives video a nice old movie look, a pastel effect which gives everything a cartoony look, black and white, 16:9 aspect shots, plus other effects. It can also do snazzy digital fade-ins and fade-outs.This camera only really has two failings. For the most part, built in camera lights are useless, but the TRV-108 doesn't even have an accessory shoe for mounting an external light source. Something I found kind of maddening to the point where I even toyed with the idea of finding a camera at a garage sale, ripping it apart, and super glue the shoe to the top. Second, while the built-in microphone is very sensitive at picking up voices and ambient sounds, it does not have a foam wind sock. In moderate winds the roar of the air as it passed over the mike caused a lot of noise. And if it's too loud, like when I shot at the base of a waterfall, the noise caused image distortion lines! These two missing features cost the camera a full five-star review.All in all though, this is a pretty decent little toy. It's not a serious camcorder and a far from a Canon GL-1s or Xl-1s, but for what I use it for, it's still pretty darn good. It's also low cost enough that purchasing it and using it as a good way to find out if you want to go for a bigger and better camera with more features, whether it be a Digital8 or Mini DV camera. It has taught me a lot about framing shots and what a pain the noon day sun can be. The long life of the battery means that, with a little mental effort, you can shoot a full 2 hour tape on one battery. Not bad for a trip to the zoo to send a tape to your folks.

review/summary: Poor battery life mars a decent camcorder
review/text: Hi8 is fast fading into oblivion as MiniDV takes over the world and gets cheaper. If you want good video quality, you should go with a namebrand MiniDV camcorder -- I recommend Sony, Panasonic and Canon. On the other hand, if you don't shoot a lot of videos and want something cheap, the Hi8 is still a good way to go. (I bought the TRV108 as a gift but tested it before giving it to my uncle-in-law.)To someone who's used to MiniDV camcorders, the TRV108 feels big. It's actually normal for a 8mm camcorder. The LCD screen is sharp and bright -- but as we shall see later, also a battery hog. The traditional eye-piece viewfinder is b&w;, which is bad if you want to use it to conserve battery power.The TRV108 gives out good video quality on Hi8 tapes. I would rate it "high" for a Hi8 model, but even the cheapest MiniDV camcorders (except for Samsung) can match such quality -- plus they offer more bells and whistles. One nice thing is the inclusion of Sony's NightShot infrared technology -- now you can turn your lights off and make those ghostly videos like in Blair Witch Project and Silence of the Lambs. :) The TRV108 also includes a host of effects you can add to your video footage.One bad thing, though, is this model does not have the stabilizer. The TRV308 and other more expensive models include Sony's digital stabilizer. On the other hand, digital stabilizers degrade quality, so they work better on a digital camcorder than an analog one like the TRV108. Just make sure you have sturdy hands and arms.Now the battery. The battery is definitely a problem and you'll want to buy an extra capacity battery. While the LCD turned on, you'll run out of the included battery in a matter of minutes. You can save power by using the b&w; viewfinder, but that defeats the purpose of having the LCD, doesn't it? One plus feature is the included AC adapter works at both 110V and 220V.If you have [the money], I highly recommend a MiniDV camcorder. Otherwise, make the TRV108 your entry-level home video making machine. You just can't beat its price and good quality for a Hi8 model.

review/summary: Best Deal in Sony Hi8 Camcorder Ever!
review/text: I've been waiting and waiting for the best value in a Sony Hi8 Camcorder and by far this is it! This is my very first camcorder. I've been doing a lot of research and comparison on which sony model will suit me best, then this came out. I quickly grabbed it after finding out how reasonably priced it was. I bought it at [a local store] during [a] Sale... I've never laid hand on a camcorder before and I am very pleased to find out how easy it was to operate. I was able to do the playback on my TV and dubbing on my VCR with ease. It has great features, great sound and best of all best picture quality. I know there are a lot of people out there like myself who are not ready to spend a lot of money on a camcorder especially for the very first time. Well, you will not be disappointed with this one! It comes with all the accessories to get you started. Battery charging is very fast, instructions are easy to follow when it comes to recording, playback and editing, the night shot feature is great, best of all the LCD screen is so fun to use especially when you have a "little one" to capture on video. This is definitely as great buy!

review/summary: Affordable Camcorder for Novice Users!
review/text: This was our family's first camcorder and I'd have to say that it does its job wonderfully. This camcorder has all the basic features you need to create great home videos. Our results so far are very satisfying. The only drawback is that you must buy an extra battery AND a camcorder bag! These are essential accessories that you must get if you plan to travel with your camcorder. What I love about this camcorder is that it could automatically convert to 220V, which is great when you travel. There's also the nightshot feature. I guess what this lacks is the 'image stabilizer.' However, I heard that stabilizers may actually worsen the picture quality on Hi8 camcorders. Whatever the case, we are very happy with our purchase and would highly recommend this product. It's high quality by a great brand and it would last you til you upgrade ...

review/summary: Great camera for the price
review/text: Wanted a camera for Christmas and got this one because of the price, and needless to say it's a great camera. Just got back from DisneyWorld and the 108 performed extremely well. The nightshot proved handy in those dark rides, and the quality of picture was well for the Festival of the Lion King performance. The only problem I saw was that the autofocus was slow to adapt at times during those fireworks and laser shows. I didn't expect it to keep up, but it did better than I expected. Talk about impact resistant, I had a hissy when it fell out of the bag into the boat on the pirates of the carribean, but it took a lickin and it's still ticking. Once home, I just connected it to my TV and watched my vacation replay. Great camera for the price, definately worth more. Only thing better is digital. Sony has a winner here.

review/summary: Replaced Old Sony TR 100 Hi 8 With this
review/text: My old hi 8 went caput after 10 years use that was very trouble free.The new one has way more features that the 100 and costs much less. ...I use the viewfinder instead of the display as I am used to it and so far have recorded 3 hours on it and it tells me I have 2 hours left. I used the telephoto constantly which takes power put am very happy with the resultsI recharge the battery after use with the no memory effect so no problems. I use the supplied battery for dubbing and it will run 2 hrs in the dubbing mode which is great.I dub hi 8 super vhs output to a super vhs vcr and do not notice andy difference in the quality of the dub.Yes there is a more blurry picture if you dub to standard vhs but that is normal.Unless you want to do some super pro stuff this camera is the one to get. Dave PS get metal evaporated tape for top notch 400 lines picture quality.

review/summary: Great for a first camera
review/text: The camera is very easy to use. It's not as bulky as other reviews make it out to be. The battery life has been great and the picture clarity has been great also. I have been using it to tape track meets and everything can be seen clearly. Remember that you will have to buy tapes for this camera, but that is no problem for the clarity you will get. I have not tried out all the other features like night vision, but from what I have seen so far, this camera is a real good bargain. I know 5 other people who have the same item and they do not have any complaints.The flip out lcd screen is clear also. It's like using a digital camera...but only with the tapes. Only downside I have seen is that it is a little hard to keep steady based on the videos watched. The camera seems to move around alot, but again, the picture clarity is great regardless of the low price. If you don't want to upgrade to ditigal, start with this camcorder. You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Serendipity!
review/text: I was very pleased with the video camera. However, it had a problem which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Like my original camera, it wouldn't move the tape in any direction. More than that, the tape would not go all the way down and came back out. Then I noticed that a rubber roller (turned out to be the capstan roller) was loose at the bottom of the tape area blocking the tape from going all the way down. I shook it out, but the tape wouldn't move ... just like the problem with my original video camera. Upon looking closer at my original camera, I noticed the capstan roller was loose in it also but not in a position that didn't prevent the tape from loading. After finding the manual on-line, I saw where the capstan went.I know I wouldn't have been able to fix my original camera if I hadn't purchased my new cameral through Amazon. Since I just paid half of what the original camera cost me (which was already heavily discounted), I am very happy with the result. Further searching on-line revealed to me that this is a common problem with this camera. The solution was also revealed ... always have a tape in the camera, and the capstan will not get loose. I suspect that when the camera was mailed to me that it was working fine, but the rigors of the shipment probably knocked the capstan loose since it came with no tape insideSony CCDTRV118 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5" LCD. I am very happy at this unusual experience, and continue to be delighted that I have had great results everytime I purchase anything from Amazon. The reason I purchased the 2nd camera is that I have a lot of tapes of my grandson (now 21) playing Little League baseball that I want to copy onto DVDs and now will take more videos of my younger grandson playing ball. One thing I've always loved about this camera is that it is easy to use, and it has a zoom to "kill for." Sometimes I use it as an electronic telescope because it is so powerful.

review/summary: GREAT CAMERA - HOMERUN!!!!!
review/text: I exclusively buy Sony Electronics because in my opinion they are the best. When I bought this Camera I knew that the quality would be there because it is a Sony. The camera works well except it is a little bulky. I primarily use this camera to film my son playing in the little league and it works well at capturing high speed action. It also is somewhat impact resistant because at his last little league game the umpire claimed my son was out when he was safe. Everyone knew that except for the umpire himself. I hit that fat porker right in the face with the camera (while it was on) and it captured everything - the picture quality was amazing and the sound was crystal clear. That fat slob hit the floor like a ton of bricks and was out cold. A couple of weeks later I got a letter from his lawyer and I had to appear in court because he filed a lawsuit against me. I showed the judge the tape of my son being safe and even he commented on the quality of the sound and picture and said my son was not out either. The judge dropped the charges all because of this great little camera.

review/text: I bought one of these to protect my washing machine. I can't really know for sure whether or not this device has protected my washer from any power surges, as both the washing machine and the APC P1T are still both fully functional, but my understanding is that APC is a highly regarded company in the power protection industry, so I believe this is a quality product.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: This is a wonderful product that is compact enough for me to keep my laptop plugged into it at all times and move it from plug to plug. When the apartment building next to mine was struck by lightning, I decided that I better get a surge protector and this portable option was just what I wanted.
